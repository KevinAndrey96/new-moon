# Option 1: Try common cPanel Node.js ports
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://127.0.0.1:3000/$1 [P,L]

# Option 2: If 3000 doesn't work, try 3001 (uncomment and comment Option 1):
# RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://127.0.0.1:3001/$1 [P,L]

# Option 3: If using socket (uncomment and comment others):
# RewriteRule ^(.*)$ unix:/mnt/saturno/nmpsicologiaenev/nodevenv/repositories/new-moon/16/run/node.sock|http://127.0.0.1/$1 [P,L]
